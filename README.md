# PythonPractice

This repository contains 4 different practice projects/exercises from various sources.

  1) PracticePython Exercises is a folder that contains practice exercises from https://www.practicepython.org/. I am still updating this to this day.
  2) Random Quiz Generator is a folder containing a script that automatically creates randomized quizzes of states and the answer keys for each quiz. This was my solution as well as a slight twist on the project from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter8/
  3) WPM Project was my own standalone solution to figuring out my own typing speed (which I might add that it isn't too bad ~105WPM) as well as playing around with the shelve and logging libraries.
  4) Web Module was to understand how to use the webbrowser library along with accepting command line arguments.
  
The goal of this repository is to get familiar with the Python language which I began teaching myself after having a solid foundation in Java.
